## Steps

1. **Set Up Kaggle API**: Create a Kaggle directory and copy your Kaggle API key to it.

2. **Download Dataset**: Download the "Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition" dataset from Kaggle.

3. **Unzip the Dataset**: Unzip the downloaded dataset.

4. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

5. **Load Datasets**: Load the training, testing, and validation datasets from the unzipped files.

6. **Print Categories**: Print the total number of categories and visualize some sample images from the training dataset.

7. **Normalize Images**: Normalize image pixel values to improve model performance.

8. **Define the CNN Model**: Define the CNN architecture using convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.

9. **Compile the Model**: Compile the CNN model with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

10. **Train the Model**: Train the CNN model on the training dataset and validate it on the validation dataset.

11. **Plot Accuracy and Loss**: Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss to monitor model performance.

12. **Predict on a New Image**: Use the trained model to predict the category of a new image and display the result.


## Achievements
- Successfully classified 36 categories of fruits and vegetables with high accuracy on both training and validation datasets.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks.
